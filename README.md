# Covid 19 :: Facial Recognition of Person Whose not Wearing Face Mask

Aim of the project is to develop a system which can automatically detect person without a face mask and identify the persons details.
This type of system can be very useful for government as they can use this easily which will help them to control covid infections
without directly sending forces to control the situation.
